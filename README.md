# MemeEngine

It does not create memes it just creates videos from those memes.

## Installation

for simplicity sake ive included almost everything in this repository but I could'nt mash teseract-ocr in here so just download tesseract-ors [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
Which is not true anymore I've included it this folder.

But that doesn't matter very much

## use

To use this software make sure you have python<sup>1</sup> installed and activate this projects venv by `$> venv\Scripts\activate.bat`.
Now you should see `(venv)$> ...`
If you see an error above don't worry aslong as you're seeing the `(venv)` prefix it should be ok√©.

## Documentation

Here comes the documentation on theutilisation of this "pakket".

## Info

Some info you need to know whilst using this software.  
1 the code is not user friendly so a little bit of python can come in helpfull  
2 Some common meme pages are :

- memes
- dankmemes
- memeeconomy
- pewdiepieSubmissions (can also include a lot of crap)

3 This is still in development soo expect a lot of changes (also I'm very lazy<sup>2</sup> so don't worry when i do nothing for like two weeks just invoke me.)
4 Don't be afraid to change my (mediocre/bad) code. Go ahead and change it. Have fun with it!

## unshure info

1. It might be plausible that their is a python interpreter in here so if yoou don't have python installed give it a try.

2) Not lazy perse I just don't have a very long attention span so I might have left this project behind but if you invoke me I'll shure work on it.
